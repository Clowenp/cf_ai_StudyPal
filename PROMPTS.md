can you create detailed explanation of cloudflare ai agents. provide a simple example of a cloudflare ai agent project and explain the various components such as workers, durable objects, etc.

explain what files such as wrangler.jsonc, vite.config.ts, etc are for and how they work

help me set up a new cloudflare workers project using the agents starter template, i need it configured with typescript, vite, and the anthropic ai sdk, make sure to include the wrangler config with durable objects support for chat persistence and ai binding.

Breate a chat agent class that extends AIChatAgent from the agents library, it should handle onChatMessage with streaming responses using claude-3-haiku, which has already been added and confirmed working via the interface in tools.ts. Include proper error handling and make sure it can manage conversation history with durable objects storage. I have provided the API token names as seen in the example environment variables file

firecrawl api error handling

build a comprehensive task scheduling tool using the agents schedule functionality, it should support scheduled dates, delayed execution, and cron patterns, include validation for different schedule types and return meaningful task ids

create getScheduledTasks and cancelScheduledTask tools for managing scheduled items, these should execute automatically and provide mock responses for now since the full agent context integration comes later

Implement authorizeGoogleCalendar tool that generates oauth urls for google calendar access, check for required environment variables (client id, secret, redirect uri), return different response types for setup required vs auth button display

can you explain google calendar api integration and oauth flow? for example what is oauth2 and how does it work

what might be causing oauth to show error 500? explain uri in the context of google apis

build createCalendarEvent and listCalendarEvents tools for google calendar integration, include proper input schemas for event details like title, description, times, location, attendees, handle cases where oauth isnt configured

create a handleGoogleCallback function to process oauth redirects from google, it should exchange authorization codes for access tokens and handle errors gracefully with proper response formatting

add debug endpoints for /debug/env and /debug/google-url to help troubleshoot oauth configuration issues, these should show masked environment variables and generate test oauth urls with proper styling
implement processToolCalls utility that handles human-in-the-loop confirmations, it should clean up incomplete tool calls and process pending executions with proper data streaming

please explain the following bug in detail, tracing function by function how the burg is thrown. then, please provide a suggested fix for the bug, detailing how the suggested fix addresses the root cause of the bug.
