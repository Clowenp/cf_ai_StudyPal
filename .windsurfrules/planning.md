# Planning and Implementation Rules

## Planning Workflow

When approaching any development task, follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Understanding Phase
- **Clarify Requirements**: Ask questions to fully understand what needs to be built
- **Identify Constraints**: Understand technical limitations, deadlines, and resources
- **Define Success Criteria**: Establish clear metrics for completion
- **Research Dependencies**: Identify required libraries, APIs, or services

### 2. Analysis Phase
- **Break Down the Problem**: Divide complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- **Identify Risks**: Anticipate potential challenges and roadblocks
- **Consider Alternatives**: Evaluate different approaches and their trade-offs
- **Estimate Effort**: Provide realistic time estimates for each component

### 3. Design Phase
- **Architecture Planning**: Design the overall system structure
- **Data Flow**: Map how data moves through the system
- **Interface Design**: Plan APIs, user interfaces, and integration points
- **Security Considerations**: Identify security requirements and implementation strategies

### 4. Implementation Strategy
- **Prioritize Features**: Start with core functionality, then add enhancements
- **Incremental Development**: Build in small, testable increments
- **Milestone Planning**: Set clear checkpoints for progress review
- **Testing Strategy**: Plan how to verify each component works correctly

## Task Breakdown Guidelines

### For Large Features
1. Create a high-level overview
2. Break into logical modules or components
3. Identify dependencies between modules
4. Plan integration points
5. Create a development timeline

### For Bug Fixes
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Identify root cause
3. Plan the fix approach
4. Consider side effects
5. Plan testing strategy

### For Refactoring
1. Identify the problem with current code
2. Plan the improved structure
3. Create a migration strategy
4. Ensure backward compatibility
5. Plan validation approach

## Decision Making Framework

### Technical Decisions
- **Performance Impact**: How will this affect system performance?
- **Maintainability**: Will this make the code easier or harder to maintain?
- **Scalability**: How will this handle increased load or data?
- **Security**: Are there any security implications?
- **Cost**: What are the resource and time costs?

### When to Ask for Help
- Requirements are unclear or contradictory
- Technical approach has significant risks
- Multiple valid solutions exist with different trade-offs
- Implementation requires expertise outside current knowledge
- Timeline or scope concerns arise

## Communication During Planning

### Status Updates
- Provide regular progress updates
- Highlight any blockers or concerns early
- Share discoveries that might affect the plan
- Communicate changes in timeline or scope

### Documentation
- Document key decisions and reasoning
- Create clear task descriptions
- Maintain up-to-date progress tracking
- Record lessons learned for future reference

## Validation and Review

### Before Implementation
- Review the plan with stakeholders
- Validate technical approach
- Confirm resource availability
- Get approval for any significant changes

### During Implementation
- Regular check-ins against the plan
- Adjust timeline based on actual progress
- Communicate any deviations from original plan
- Maintain quality standards throughout

### After Completion
- Review what worked well and what didn't
- Document lessons learned
- Update processes based on experience
- Celebrate successful completion
