# Windsurf Rules Configuration

This directory contains rules files that guide Windsurf's AI assistant (Cascade) behavior for this project.

## Rules Files

### `cloudflare.md`
Specialized rules for Cloudflare Workers development, including:
- Cloudflare-specific best practices and patterns
- Service integration guidelines (KV, D1, R2, Durable Objects, etc.)
- WebSocket and Agent development patterns
- Security and performance guidelines
- Comprehensive code examples

### `general.md`
General development best practices covering:
- Code quality standards
- Security guidelines
- Performance optimization
- File organization
- Error handling patterns

### `planning.md`
Project planning and implementation methodology:
- Systematic approach to problem-solving
- Task breakdown strategies
- Decision-making frameworks
- Communication guidelines

### `debugging.md`
Debugging and troubleshooting guidelines:
- Systematic debugging methodology
- Common debugging strategies
- Tools and techniques
- Prevention strategies

## How It Works

Windsurf automatically applies these rules when you interact with the AI assistant. The rules help ensure:

1. **Consistent Code Quality**: Following established patterns and best practices
2. **Domain Expertise**: Specialized knowledge for Cloudflare Workers development
3. **Systematic Approach**: Structured methodology for planning and problem-solving
4. **Effective Debugging**: Proven strategies for troubleshooting issues

## Usage

Simply interact with Windsurf's AI assistant as normal. The rules are automatically applied to provide:
- More accurate and relevant suggestions
- Adherence to project-specific patterns
- Better error handling and security practices
- Comprehensive examples and explanations

## Customization

You can modify these rules files to better match your project's specific needs:
- Add project-specific patterns or constraints
- Include additional libraries or frameworks
- Modify coding standards to match team preferences
- Add domain-specific knowledge for your use case

## Based On

These rules were adapted from the Cursor Cloudflare starter template and enhanced with general development best practices based on community templates and industry standards.
